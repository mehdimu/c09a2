The most difficult part about this assignmnet was to get the POST request working.
In the reviews, we had to change the post url. It was hard to figure out
on how to maintain the url. For example, for each review, we needed to
maintain the url, like /movies/2312123/reviews, we had to keep the id
of the movie and pass it in the view.

Another difficulty was to get the css working for the thumbnails review swatch.
The reason this was causing trouble was due to the lack of experience with CSS.

Something to note for the marker:
We used mongolab to manage the MongoDB.
It has a nice GUI for managing the database.
Please change the config file accordingly.
When creating a review, we have set the default value to be rotten.
